bob@bob-OptiPlex-3020:~/src/emacs-24.4$ sudo apt-get build-dep emacs24
kembomatoMacBook:emacs kembostaff$   /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.4/bin/emacs -version

sudo brew install emacs --with-cocoa

A command line wrapper for the cocoa app was installed to:
/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.5/bin/emacs

To have launchd start emacs at login:
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/emacs/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load emacs now:
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.emacs.plist
.app bundles were installed.
Run `brew linkapps emacs` to symlink these to /Applications.
