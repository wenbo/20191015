----------------------  move ----------------------------------
Here is a summary of simple cursor-moving operations, including the
word and sentence moving commands:

C-f     Move forward a character
C-b     Move backward a character

M-f     Move forward a word
M-b     Move backward a word

C-n     Move to next line
C-p     Move to previous line

C-a     Move to beginning of line
C-e     Move to end of line

M-a     Move back to beginning of sentence
M-e     Move forward to end of sentence
----------------------  move ----------------------------------

----------------------- delete --------------------------------
>> Move the cursor to this line and type C-u 0 C-l.
>> Type C-h k C-f.
See how this window shrinks, while a new one appears
to display documentation on the C-f command.
>> Type C-x 1 and see the documentation listing window disappear.

>> Try that now -- type C-u 8 * to insert ********.

You've now learned the most basic way of typing something in
Emacs and correcting errors.  You can delete by words or lines
as well.  Here is a summary of the delete operations:

<DEL>        Delete the character just before the cursor
C-d          Delete the next character after the cursor

M-<DEL>      Kill the word immediately before the cursor
M-d      Kill the next word after the cursor

C-k      Kill from the cursor position to end of line
M-k      Kill to the end of the current sentence

  You can also kill a segment of text with one uniform method.  Move to
one end of that part, and type C-<SPC>.  (<SPC> is the Space bar.)
  Next, move the cursor to the other end of the text you intend to kill.
  As you do this, Emacs highlights the text between the cursor and the
  position where you typed C-<SPC>.  Finally, type C-w.  This kills all
  the text between the two positions.
----------------------- delete --------------------------------
----------------------- undo ----------------------------------
A numeric argument to C-/, C-_, or C-x u acts as a repeat count.
----------------------- undo ----------------------------------
----------------------- file ----------------------------------
>> Type C-x C-f, then type C-g.  This cancels the minibuffer,
  and also cancels the C-x C-f command that was using the
  minibuffer.  So you do not find any file.
>> Type C-x C-s TUTORIAL <Return>.
   This should save this tutorial to a file named TUTORIAL, and show
   "Wrote ...TUTORIAL" at the bottom of the screen.
----------------------- file ----------------------------------
----------------------- BUFFERS ----------------------------------
>> Try C-x C-b now.

See how each buffer has a name, and it may also have a file name for
the file whose contents it holds.  ANY text you see in an Emacs window
is always part of some buffer.

>> Type C-x 1 to get rid of the buffer list.

>> Create a file named "foo" by typing C-x C-f foo <Return>.
   Then type C-x b TUTORIAL <Return> to come back to this tutorial.


The buffer named "*Messages*" also does not correspond to any file.
This buffer contains the messages that have appeared on the bottom
line during your Emacs session.

>> Type C-x b *Messages* <Return> to look at the buffer of messages.
   Then type C-x b TUTORIAL <Return> to come back to this tutorial.
----------------------- BUFFERS ----------------------------------

* EXTENDING THE COMMAND SET
---------------------------
C-x C-f         Find file
C-x C-s         Save file
C-x s           Save some buffers
C-x C-b         List buffers
C-x b           Switch buffer
C-x C-c         Quit Emacs
C-x 1           Delete all but one window
C-x u           Undo

C-z is the command to exit Emacs *temporarily*--so that you can go
back to the same Emacs session afterward.  When Emacs is running on a
text terminal, C-z "suspends" Emacs; that is, it returns to the shell
but does not destroy the Emacs job.  In the most common shells, you
can resume Emacs with the `fg' command or with `%emacs'.

Named eXtended commands are commands which are used even less
frequently, or commands which are used only in certain modes.  An
example is the command replace-string, which replaces one string with
another in the buffer.  When you type M-x, Emacs prompts you at the
OAbottom of the screen with M-x and you should type the name of the
command; in this case, "replace-string".  Just type "repl s<TAB>" and
Emacs will complete the name.  (<TAB> is the Tab key, usually found
above the CapsLock or Shift key near the left edge of the keyboard.)
Submit the command name with <Return>.
The replace-string command requires two arguments--the string to be
replaced, and the string to replace it with.  You must end each
argument with <Return>.
>> Move the cursor to the blank line two lines below this one.
Then type M-x repl s<Return>changed<Return>altered<Return>.
Notice how this line has changed: you've replaced the word
"changed" with "altered" wherever it occurred, after the
initial position of the cursor.


* MODE LINE
-----------
If you are going to be editing human-language text, such as this file, you
should probably use Text Mode.

>> Type M-x text-mode <Return>.

Don't worry, none of the Emacs commands you have learned changes in
any great way.  But you can observe that M-f and M-b now treat
apostrophes as part of words.  Previously, in Fundamental mode,
M-f and M-b treated apostrophes as word-separators.

Major modes usually make subtle changes like that one: most commands
do "the same job" in each major mode, but they work a little bit
differently.

To view documentation on your current major mode, type C-h m.

>> Move the cursor to the line following this line.
>> Type C-l C-l to bring this line to the top of screen.
>> Type C-h m, to see how Text mode differs from Fundamental mode.
>> Type C-x 1 to remove the documentation from the screen.

>> Type M-x auto-fill-mode <Return> now.  Then insert a line of "asdf "
over again until you see it divide into two lines.  You must put in
spaces between them because Auto Fill breaks lines only at spaces.

The margin is usually set at 70 characters, but you can change it
with the C-x f command.  You should give the margin setting you want
as a numeric argument.

>> Type C-x f with an argument of 20.  (C-u 2 0 C-x f).
Then type in some text and see Emacs fill lines of 20
characters with it.  Then set the margin back to 70 using
C-x f again.

If you make changes in the middle of a paragraph, Auto Fill mode
does not re-fill it for you.
To re-fill the paragraph, type M-q (META-q) with the cursor inside
that paragraph.

>> Move the cursor into the previous paragraph and type M-q.

* SEARCHING
-----------
If you are in the middle of a search and type a control or meta
character (with a few exceptions--characters that are special in a
    search, such as C-s and C-r), the search is terminated.

C-s starts a search that looks for any occurrence of the search string
AFTER the current cursor position.  If you want to search for
something earlier in the text, type C-r instead.  Everything that we
have said about C-s also applies to C-r, except that the direction of
the search is reversed.

* MULTIPLE WINDOWS
------------------

One of the nice features of Emacs is that you can display more than
one window on the screen at the same time.  (Note that Emacs uses the
term "frames"--described in the next section--for what some other
applications call "windows".  The Emacs manual contains a Glossary of
Emacs terms.)

>> Move the cursor to this line and type C-l C-l.

>> Now type C-x 2 which splits the screen into two windows.
   Both windows display this tutorial.  The editing cursor stays in
   the top window.

>> Type C-M-v to scroll the bottom window.
   (If you do not have a real META key, type <ESC> C-v.)

>> Type C-x o ("o" for "other") to move the cursor to the bottom window.
>> Use C-v and M-v in the bottom window to scroll it.
   Keep reading these directions in the top window.

>> Type C-x o again to move the cursor back to the top window.
   The cursor in the top window is just where it was before.

You can keep using C-x o to switch between the windows.  The "selected
window", where most editing takes place, is the one with a prominent
cursor which blinks when you are not typing.  The other windows have
their own cursor positions; if you are running Emacs in a graphical
display, those cursors are drawn as unblinking hollow boxes.

The command C-M-v is very useful when you are editing text in one
window and using the other window just for reference.  Without leaving
the selected window, you can scroll the text in the other window with
C-M-v.

* MULTIPLE FRAMES
------------------

Emacs can also create multiple "frames".  A frame is what we call one
collection of windows, together with its menus, scroll bars, echo
area, etc.  On graphical displays, what Emacs calls a "frame" is what
most other applications call a "window".  Multiple graphical frames
can be shown on the screen at the same time.  On a text terminal, only
one frame can be shown at a time.

>> Type M-x make-frame <Return>.
See a new frame appear on your screen.

You can do everything you did in the original frame in the new frame.
There is nothing special about the first frame.

>> Type M-x delete-frame <Return>.
This removes the selected frame.

* GETTING MORE HELP
-------------------
The most basic HELP feature is C-h c.  Type C-h, the character c, and
a command character or sequence; then Emacs displays a very brief
description of the command.

>> Type C-h c C-p.

The message should be something like this:

        C-p runs the command previous-line

This tells you the "name of the function".  Since function names
are chosen to indicate what the command does, they can serve as
very brief documentation--sufficient to remind you of commands you
have already learned.

Multi-character commands such as C-x C-s and (if you have no META or
EDIT or ALT key) <ESC>v are also allowed after C-h c.

To get more information about a command, use C-h k instead of C-h c.

>> Type C-h k C-p.

C-h f        Describe a function.  You type in the name of the
function.
>> Try typing C-h f previous-line <Return>.
This displays all the information Emacs has about the
function which implements the C-p command.

C-h a        Command Apropos.  Type in a keyword and Emacs will list
all the commands whose names contain that keyword.
These commands can all be invoked with META-x.
For some commands, Command Apropos will also list a one
or two character sequence which runs the same command.
>> Type C-h a file <Return>.

C-h i        Read included Manuals (a.k.a. Info).  This command puts
you into a special buffer called `*info*' where you
can read manuals for the packages installed on your system.
Type m emacs <Return> to read the Emacs manual.
If you have never before used Info, type ? and Emacs
will take you on a guided tour of Info mode facilities.
Once you are through with this tutorial, you should
consult the Emacs Info manual as your primary documentation.
